If you live in California, taking out a payday loan is one way you may be able to get cash for short-term financial needs.

But keep in mind that payday loans in California are capped at $300 and can come with high fees and short repayment terms. The maximum term for repayment is 31 days.

If you need cash fast, you donâ€™t necessarily have to resort to high-interest loans from payday lenders. There are other options, including cash advance apps, payday alternative loans from federal credit unions, and personal loans from lenders that work with people who have less-than-perfect credit.

Here are our picks for best alternatives to payday loans in California to help you decide which one may be right for you.
