Why you may want to consider Earnin: Earnin is an app available to both Apple and Android users. Like a payday loan, it lets you borrow small amounts of money against your next paycheck. Payday advances start at $100 per pay period and may increase to up to $500 if you continue to use the app. When you use Earnin, the amount you borrow is automatically deducted from your checking account on your next payday.

No interest or fees — Unlike payday loans, which often charge exorbitant APRs, Earnin doesn’t charge fees or interest on the amount you borrow. Instead, Earnin asks people to provide optional “tips” when they get cash. But tipping is not a requirement to use the app.
Funding speed — With the app’s Lightning Speed feature, you can get your money the same day you request it, but this feature isn’t available everywhere. If your bank doesn’t support Lightning Speed, your funds will probably be deposited in your account in one to two business days. But keep in mind that there may be a delay between when the funds are deposited and when you can access them.
Eligibility requirements — To use the Earnin app, you must have a regular pay schedule — such as weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. More than 50% of your paycheck needs to be direct deposited into a single checking account each payday. And you must either work at the same location every day or use online timesheets to track your hours.
Earnings — After taxes and other deductions are withdrawn from your paycheck, you must earn at least $4 an hour. Keep in mind, when Earnin calculates your hourly rate, it only uses money directly deposited into the checking account you link to the app. Tips and commission you earn that aren’t sent to your checking account via direct deposit aren’t included in Earnin’s calculation.
